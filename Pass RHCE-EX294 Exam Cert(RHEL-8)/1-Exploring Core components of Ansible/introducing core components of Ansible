   Ansible Inventories:
        Ansible inventories are nothing but the list of remote system put
        together in a file know as inventory file.

    hostvars and group vars :
We can define hostvars and groupvars in inventory file.

how to organize the vars ?
Normally we can define in inventory file below host and group , the
another method we can put the vars in a file like below
=========================================
# vi /etc/ansible/hosts/host_vars/node1

# vi /etc/ansible/hosts/grop_vars/web_grb
=========================================

ALL group in the inventory file is the default group , every host is part
of ALL group and - group

whichever the host is not part of group is ungroup which is also the
default group in Ansible - UNGROUP

Modules:
=======
ping, setup, yum, yum_repository, service, package, systemd, cron, lvg,
lvol, parted, tempalte , fetch.

Modules are descrite units of code that can be used from the command line
or in the playbook tasks. Ansible execute each module usally on the remote
node, and collect return value.
